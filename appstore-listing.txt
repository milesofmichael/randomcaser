PROMOTIONAL TEXT (170 chars max, can be updated anytime without a new build)
Type it. Randomize it. Send it. The fastest way to send chaotic text in iMessage — now with 5 stunning themes.

DESCRIPTION
tYpE sOmEtHiNg NoRmAl. gEt SoMeThInG wEiRd.

RandomCaser lives right inside iMessage. Type your text, tap to randomize the case, and send it — all without leaving the conversation.

HOW IT WORKS
Type or paste any text. Tap Re-Randomize until it looks just right (or just wrong enough). Send it directly, drop it in the message box to edit first, or copy it to your clipboard.

THREE WAYS TO USE IT
Send Message — fires it straight into the chat.
Add to Message Box — drops it into the compose field so you can tweak it before sending.
Copy to Clipboard — grab it for use anywhere else on your device.

GO PRO — ONE PRICE, FOREVER
Unlock 5 handcrafted themes with a single purchase. No subscriptions. No ads. Just vibes.

THEMES
Sage Park — calm, sophisticated greens inspired by a luxury hotel lobby.
Beach Claw — warm sand tones with cool ocean blue accents.
Royal Purple — bold, regal purple for when you're feeling fancy.
Red n Black — high-contrast and unapologetically loud.
Robotic — clean, minimal, pure system design.

Built with Liquid Glass on iOS 26 for a modern, premium feel.

Perfect for roasting your group chat, making a point, or just being chaotic.
